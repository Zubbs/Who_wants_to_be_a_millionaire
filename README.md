# Million
 Who wants to be a millionaire game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (Play in Browser)

 My start page is index.html. 
 I have a program that prints the start page's html and resets game cookies so you can play again. That program is index.py.

 I have programs: login.py and  register.py which will allow registered users be able to access the forbes list.

 In the main game, I use game.js as well as game.py.
